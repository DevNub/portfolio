//How can I stay focused?

Tips to stay focused
"You should think of, or find a good project that will keep your interest for a while. Something that will challenge you with 
concepts and features JUST beyond your reach." 

"The start learning that. Don't limit yourself...stop doing watching porn and gaming. Seriously, it is that easy. No one ever 
expanded their learning wasting their time like that. If you're bored, find a good project that excites you and start working on it."

"The more interesting that project is to you personally the more work you'll be prepared to put into it, so make it something that 
you really want to see or do yourself."

"One way I try to learn new things, is to look at the questions people post at this forum and then think how I would approach 
 - and maybe solve - the issue."

//What do I need to know to start working for clients?

"More than the client does. That's the only correct answer. You either have to know something they don't know, or be willing to
 do something they don't want to do themselves. That's the only real way to make money."

 
//Regarding Website Design

"If you already have learned the basic thing about HTML, CSS and JavaScript it does sounds like a good idea to look into the
 "backend" and learn some server side language." 
 
 "As for your actual experience: 
 If you believe that you can design websites which are beautiful, functional, and easy to use, you may be able to stick to an
 entirely front-end role, making user interfaces and doing design work."
 
 "If you are not a very creative or successful designer, you should learn a popular back-end language like PHP, JSP, or Python.
  I would recommend against learning a particular CMS, that's just limiting yourself for no reason."
