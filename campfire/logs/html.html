							Working through html, in terms of coding and uploading for this site, is challenging. 
							Although challenging, it is interesting to know that I can do something like this with a little perseverance.
							A few of the challenges I faced recently with uploading was two of my new webpages only loading up text. 
							Well, yeah text, not html code. Thing is, I already coded my styling for the website but for the life of me,
							I just could not understand why things damned thing kept coming up with a white background!! I gave up after two days
							of endless sole trials for errors within the hour or two. <br>
							<br>
							Stressing? Yes it was, hella stressing. After cooling off for 4 days, I was back, ready to look at the problem from a new
							angle. BAM!, what do you know, figured it out. The problem was my style sheet. I had linked it correctly but it was still
							missing. The new webpages I introduced were in a new directory. Meanwhile, the style sheet I linked these webpages to,
							had remained in my root directory. Following the first solution that came to mind, I immediately copied all files relevant
							to my style sheet AND lets not forget, my style sheet else I would still be in deep -. Thinking about it now, I realize that
							It would be better if I had just linked to the root directory instead of stacking up on files and going through problems if
							or when I add something new to my style sheets.
							<br>
							<br>Tl;dr Style Sheet, wrong place.

							Returned once more, after giving my website a break since ... well, things were not working out as planned. I will explain why,
							I had left coding my website once more but not too long this time, anyway the problem which occured this time, was my css once
							again, causing me back pains. I noticed that some of my containers remained out of place after multiple tries at editing to
							an acceptable solution; to no avail - at the time. With the help of google's online element inspection, I was able to see a 
							checklist of code in my style sheet. A checklist, yes, so I was able to uncheck some items, just meddling with it at first
							and a few seconds later, realizing that this in it self was helpful. I knew that the problem was within the style sheet from
							day one, but not the where. I had created a whole new style sheet just so that this page would have a separate styling sheet.
							That did not work, still puzzled, I put it down until another time. This time, I successfully fixed the problem by removing some
							unnecessary coding, and tweaking a few values.<br><br>

							So far, I have learnt that your css can be very dangerous; especially if you don't know what you are doing.
							Although it's good to try without knowing, but never give up.<br><br>

							Tips to stay focused
							"You should think of, or find a good project that will keep your interest for a while. Something that will challenge you with 
							concepts and features JUST beyond your reach." 

							"The start learning that. Don't limit yourself...stop doing watching porn and gaming. Seriously, it is that easy. No one ever 
							expanded their learning wasting their time like that. If you're bored, find a good project that excites you and start working on it."

							"The more interesting that project is to you personally the more work you'll be prepared to put into it, so make it something that 
							you really want to see or do yourself."

							Back to the main topic, whatever it is - tl;dr
							I am going to start more programming as I learn through posts in this forum.
