								Introduction<br>
								This section is for Photoshop and After Effects, hence the name PSD/AE, I can noobly say that I have never used After Effects
								before in my life. Everything I will do in After Effects to start off, will be towards a group presentation. A movie, we call it
								Myself and another member of the group will be working using After Effects to enhance the movie however, not much other than the
								plot is already completed, everything else seems like a piece of cake but it is time to get down and d-o work. Get work done.
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>

								As for photoshop ... to be honest,I actually have used photoshop before for random things, some professional things as well.
								I will only be taking notes of the things I produce using photoshop as of now, the older things just wont get anymore publicity
								other than "the older things" haha. Anyway, what I have planned never goes as planned but I will say that I intend to use 
								photoshop to enhance my personal artwork, thinking of it as painting... but without the tangible paint. I am currently working
								on a second piece of artwork to be photoshopped; more information soon. <br>
