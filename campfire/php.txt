"PHP" is a back end or server side programming language and one of the more popular ones. It is recommended that upcoming website
developers learn a back end scripting language after understanding the ins and outs of the HTML language. Currently I am looking about
gaining a better understanding of the language; PHP coding that is. This log will be used for the sake of noting the learning experience.
